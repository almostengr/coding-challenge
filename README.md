# Coding Challenge

This contains coding challenges that I have attempted in the past. Each folder represents a
challenge and is a self-contained
project. For more details about each challenge, see the details within that folder
All of the challenges in this repository are done in .NET Core with C#.

I occasionally do coding challenges because it allows me to utilize my skills while allowing me
to do something different than the usual. Look at it like this... if you always ate salads, at some 
point you would get tired of salads and might eat a steak. This is how coding is for me. I primarily 
work doing web development and web-based applications. On occasion, I want something different.
